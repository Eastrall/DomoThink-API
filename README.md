# DomoThink-Test-API

DomoThink is a home automation project. We want to create a simple box that can communicate with all your connected objects. Our vision is to allow home automation to people who doesn't have a large computer science knowledge to control their home from there mobiles.

Our team is divide in 3 teams:
- Operational team (This team is responsible for the maintenance of the box that comunicates with the objects)
- Core team (this team is responsible for the developpment of the Core API in C++. This API is the interface between the objects and the mobile applications)
- Mobile team (this team is responsible for the developpment of the mobile applications like Android, iOS and Windows 10 apps.)

This is a test API for the DomoThink project. We develop this API in order to test our mobile applications while we wait the true C++ API developped by our Core Team.
